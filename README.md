The goal of this project was to create an operational game of Rock Paper Scissors using what we have learned so far from Javascript. I have coding experience (Computer Science student with python, C and C++ experience), so learning Javascript is moreso learning a new syntax than it is learning how to code for the first time. Aside from accidentally using syntax from those other languages, I had a relatively smooth time with this project; I feel like I have a pretty basic understanding of the new syntax, or at least for the most common tools that are used in all languages I have learned thus far.
